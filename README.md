# AtomicFrustratometer_Results
Results for atomic frustratometer manuscript.

1: To visualize the results, one must install pymol or VMD on your personal computer. 
To visualize using pymol, please use the following command: 
$path2pymol/PyMOL example.pdb  example.pml

To visualize using VMD, please use the following command: 
$path2vmd/vmd example.pdb -e example.tcl

2: The compressed file COX1_DRUG_PDB_Frust.zip contains the frustration analyses of inhibitors bound to COX1. Both the selective and non-selective inhibitors are contained. 

3: The compressed file COX2_DRUG_PDB_Frust.zip contains the frustration analyses of inhibitors bound to COX2. Both the selective and non-selective inhibitors are contained. 

4: The compressed file EGFR_DRUG.zip contains the frustration analyses of inhibitors bound to EGFR kinases. 

5: The compressed file Ligand_MOAD_Holo.zip contains the results for surveying atomic frustration in a representative database for protein-ligand complexes. The results are divided into three compressed files.  

6: The compressed file Ligand_MOAD_Apo.zip contains the results for surveying atomic frustration in a representative database for proteins-only (ligands are removed). The results are divided into three compressed files. 

7: The compressed file Monomer_Survey.tar.gz contains the results for surveying atomic frustration in a non-redundant database of protein monomers.

8: The compressed file Allostery_Survey.tar.gz contains the results for surveying atomic frustration in a database of allosteric pairs with solved crystal structures. 

9: The compressed file Enzyme_Survey.tar.gz contains the results for surveying atomic frustration in a database of enzymes. The results are divided into four compressed files due to limits in size. 

10: The compressed file BenchMarkII_Monomer_Survey.tar.gz contains the results for frustration analyses of monomeric parts that sits in a complex structure from BenchMarkII database. 

11: The compressed file BenchMarkII_Complex_Survey.tar.gz contains the results for frustration analyses of complexes from BenchMarkII database.
